Echo Cancellation
======

# Introduction
This is the GitHub page for Speech Signal Echo Cancellation, which is one of the projects in the summer internship.<br>
The program consists of:<br>
* Room echo creation
* Double-talk detector using Geigel algorithm
* NLMS adaptive filer
* Non-linear processor
* Echo Return Loss Enhancement (ERLE) calculation

The main contributor to this project is:<br>
`Zhuowen Lin`<br>
The programming language is MATLAB. 
The nomenclature of the variables in the program follows the nomenclature in the instruction article [*Implementation of an Acoustic Echo Canceller Using Matlab*](http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2452&context=etd)
